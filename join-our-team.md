<p>Dear real estate agent:</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you’re either looking to take the next step in your career and start producing at a high level or you want to pursue a career in the real estate industry.  </p>

<p>If you’re already an agent, you may find yourself lacking the support you need in order to truly advance your career. Many agents in your position feel the same way because they spend too much time on non-dollar producing activities. The biggest prohibitor to their success is all the time they have to spend on transaction coordination, scheduling, offer preparation, lead follow up, pipeline management, etc. </p>

<p>In other words, they’re constantly burning the midnight oil because they have to do everything themselves. If this sounds familiar, it may be you who’s always awake at 3 a.m. trying to handle all that follow up and paperwork. </p>

<p>Some agents try solving this problem by hiring their own admin staff, but this process can be frustrating and involve a high amount of turnover. If they don’t solve this problem, they either burnout or fall into a cycle of hiring and firing that harms their production.</p>

<p>That being said, is it any wonder that 87% of all agents fail within their first 18 months in the business? I’ve been through this same cycle, and I know how difficult it is to get out of. If your end goal is to make more sales and earn more money, being on the right team will alleviate the stress of worrying about admin responsibilities and take you where you want to go. </p>

<p>That’s why today I’d like to invite you to become a member of my team.  </p>

<p>My name is Ryan Butler, and I started my real estate career back in 2017 by winning the Rookie of the Year award for Keller Williams Realty in the DC/Maryland region. In three years, I’ve been able to amass a team that’s on track to sell 175 units in 2019 alone. The average agent does between four and six transactions per year. Our agents do 10x that amount. </p>

<p>How? We provide the admin staff who handles follow up, provides touch programs, and supplies our agents with appointments. That’s right, we don’t just provide leads—we provide appointments. </p>

<p>Specifically, here’s what we can offer you:
<ul class="indent">
<li>The opportunity to work alongside experienced agents who sell many homes.</li>
<li>Our highly effective touch program, including quarterly appreciation parties where you can invite your whole sphere of influence.</li>
<li>A CRM with ISA’s who will follow up with your SOI leads and schedule appointments.</li>
<li>A team atmosphere that encourages top production.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>On top of that, you’ll be able to focus on what you’re good at, which will help you make more money and keep a healthy balance between your work life and home life. </p>

<p>There are always alternatives to what I’m offering. You can either choose to not work as hard and make fewer sales, or work harder all by yourself to make more sales but have even less time to devote outside of work. </p>

<p>The agents on our team serve as a testament to what we can do for you instead. One of them, in fact, joined us three years ago when they were producing very little, but now they’re on track to close 40 deals this year. </p>

<p>So, my offer is this: Let us take care of the administration, marketing and providing you the opportunity to earn more business than ever while you focus on what you do best- getting clients homes sold. You’ll receive 30% of the commission for seller transactions, and 40% for buyer transactions.</p>

<p>If you take me up on this offer, the first thing we’ll do is have you go through our onboarding process. We’ll develop your business plan, and along with that business plan, you’ll attend team meetings and answer accountability calls. We’ll then train you on buyer and seller presentations and input your database into our CRM. </p>

<p>If you follow our system, within two years you’ll be making $150,000 per year. </p>

<p>If you’re interested in taking advantage of this opportunity, I urge you to respond soon, because we’re only filling a handful of positions. Only top-notch go-getters need apply, so if that’s you, let’s take the next step in your career together. </p>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

<p>Ryan Butler</p>
